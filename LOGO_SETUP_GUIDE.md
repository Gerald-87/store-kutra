## Next Steps (Optional):

### For Production Deployment:
If you want pixel-perfect icons, you can:

1. **Convert SVG to PNG**: Use online tools like:
   - https://svgtopng.com/
   - https://convertio.co/svg-png/
   - Adobe Illustrator or Figma

2. **Generate Multiple Sizes**: Create these sizes from your icon.svg:
   - 1024x1024 (App Store)
   - 512x512 (Google Play Store)
   - 192x192 (Android high-res)
   - 180x180 (iOS)

3. **Update app.json**: Replace `./assets/icon.svg` with `./assets/icon.png`

### For Development/Testing:
The current SVG setup works perfectly for:
- Expo development builds
- Testing on simulators/emulators
- Web deployment

## Current Brand Colors:
- Primary Brown: #8B4513
